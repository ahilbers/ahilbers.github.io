## About Me 

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/adriaan.jpg">

I'm a PhD student in statistics and machine learning applied to renewable energy, at Imperial College London. I'm supervised by [Axel Gandy](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) and [David Brayshaw](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/david-brayshaw/) and funded by the [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Mathematics for Planet Earth](https://www.mpecdt.org).

Besides my research, I worked as machine learning intern in the supply chain optimisation group at Amazon and as data scientist at the Boston Consulting Group. I am also former director of Content Creation for [The London Journal of Energy](http://energyjournal.co.uk).

**Recruiters**: Currently scheduled to graduate in Q3 2022, so unavailable for full time opportunities that require a start before then (although internships are possible).
