### Blog: articles for general audiences

The following articles are catered to a general audience interested in (renewable) energy. I write about themes that are popular in the media or that I get asked about a lot.

* [Why renewables are difficult](why_renewables_are_difficult): challenges of making 100% renewable electricity systems and possible solutions.

* [What's the deal with nuclear?](whats_the_deal_with_nuclear): advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power in the energy transition and why it's so controversial.

* [How renewable are renewables really?](https://whyitrainedtoday.co.uk/index.php/2018/11/29/how-renewable-are-renewables-really/): clean energy's material requirements, the effect on the energy transition and possible solutions. Co-authored with [Mariana Clare](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/m.clare17).
