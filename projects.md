The following articles are catered to a general audience interested in (renewable) energy. I write about themes that are popular in the media or that I get asked about a lot.

* [What's the deal with nuclear?](https://whyitrainedtoday.co.uk/index.php/2018/10/15/whats-the-deal-with-nuclear/): advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power in the energy transition and why it's so controversial.

* [How renewable are renewables really?](https://whyitrainedtoday.co.uk/index.php/2018/11/29/how-renewable-are-renewables-really/): clean energy's material requirements, the effect on the energy transition and possible solutions.
