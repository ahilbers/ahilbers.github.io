## *Storage: the holy grail*

*Originally published 2022*

The desire to phase out the use of fossil fuels for energy is well-established now. The main reason was (and probably still is) the need to reduce the impacts of climate change by emitting fewer greenhouse gases, which come when fossil fuels are burned to generate useful energy. Another motivation is energy independence, which became especially relevant during Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the world's (especially Europe's) dependence on energy imports from dangerous and unreliable partners. 

Thankfully, the last few years have been enormous decreases in the price of renewables, which, on a per MWh basis, are the cheapest forms of energy in almost all markets now. *Add OWID article*. Some economists, such as Noah Smith, expect this to herald a new time of cheap and abundant energy. *Add Noah Smith blog*. 

Out comes the classic criticism of renewable energy: "how do we get energy when its not sunny or windy?". This criticism is justified; it's objectively true that wind power doesn't produce any electricity when there's no wind, and ditto for solar panels.
