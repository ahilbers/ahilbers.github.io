## PhD research

**Supervisors**: [Axel Gandy](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) (Imperial College London, lead) and [David Brayshaw](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/david-brayshaw/) (University of Reading).

My PhD focuses on using statistics to make the best decisions in the energy transition, particularly in the electricity sector. Such decisions (e.g. whether to build a wind farm, battery or new transmission line) are typically difficult due to the complexity of electricity grids and considerable uncertainty regarding future government policy, grid developments, demand patterns and weather events.

For this reason, electricity strategy is typically informed by large amounts of data. For example, to determine the best location of a new wind farm, wind speeds for each hour in the last 10 years across different regions of the grid can be employed, along with a computer simulation of the electricity grid. This leads to a natural statistics problem: how do we use the available data to make the best decisions in the energy transition?
