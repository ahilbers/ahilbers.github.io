## PhD Research

**Supervisors**: [Axel Gandy](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) (Imperial College London, lead) and [David Brayshaw](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/david-brayshaw/) (University of Reading).

My PhD focuses on making the best data-driven decisions in the energy transition, particularly regarding power (electricity) systems. Such choices (e.g. whether to build a wind farm, battery or new transmission line) are complicated due the complexity of the grid (which makes the effect of a choice difficult to estimate) and considerable uncertainty regarding future government policy, grid developments, demand patterns and weather events.

One way of informing such decisions is by simulating electricity systems using historial demand & weather data. However, future demand & weather patterns may differ. In this way, decision-making becomes a natural statistical problem: how can we use data to make the best decisions in the energy transition?
