## PhD research

**Supervisors**: [Axel Gandy](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~agandy/) (Imperial College London) and [David Brayshaw](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/david-brayshaw/) (University of Reading).

My PhD focuses on using statistics to make the best decisions in the energy transition, particularly in the electricity sector. Such decisions (e.g. whether to build a wind farm, battery or new transmission line) are typically difficult due to the complexity of electricity grids and considerable uncertainty regarding future government policy, grid developments, electricity demand/price patterns and weather events.

For this reason, electricity strategy is typically informed by large amounts of data. For example, to determine the best location of a new wind farm, historic wind speeds and electricity prices may be employed, along with a model of the grid. This leads to a natural statistics problem: how do we use the available data to make the best decisions in the energy transition?
